tsphp-eclipse-projects
=======================

Contains project templates for Eclipse of all TSPHP components as well as a dictionary en_GB and an ant build file which can be used as a helper to integrate all components (basically calls "cp.all clean build" on all components in the correct order). In case the project specific formatting should not be activated, then you can import the provided `tsphp_code_convention_formatter.xml`.

The templates shall help you to get started contributing to the project. Follow the instructions given in the [Contribute to the project](http://tsphp.ch/wiki/display/TSPHP/Contribute+to+the+project "Contribute to the project - wiki page") page on the [wiki](http://tsphp.ch/wiki "TSPHP's wiki")

Very briefly:

1. Clone each component in https://github.com/tsphp/ into one folder 
2. download the templates (either clone the repository or just download the zip)
3. extract the templates in the same folder as the components
4. You should be set up and ready :)
